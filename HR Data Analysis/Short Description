- HR Data Analysis 
- Leveraging the functionality of Power BI Service, 
- I have created an interactive dashboard with advanced features like conditional formatting, 
  new measures and columns, pivot tables, and data modeling.
- This task involves importing and transforming employee data from Excel, creating basic visualizations like a bar chart 
  for department distribution, and implementing features like slicers for filtering based on job roles in Power BI. 
- It also covers more advanced concepts such as joining data from different sources, calculating age groups 
  and attrition rates, and using DAX for measures and time intelligence. The goal is to create dynamic 
  and interactive reports that provide valuable insights into employee data.
